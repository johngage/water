Mantap, vaporizing granite rock within a cavity about 160 feet (50 meters) across – the size of a football stadium – and damaging a volume of rock about 1,000 feet (300 meters) across. The blast likely raised the mountain six feet (2 meters) and pushed it outward up to 11 feet (3-4 meters), though within minutes, hours or days the rock above the cavity collapsed to form a depression. Eight and a half minutes after the bomb blast, a nearby underground cavity collapsed, producing the 4.5-magnitude aftershock with the characteristics of an implosion. Subsequently, a much larger volume of fractured rock, perhaps 1 mile (1-2 kilometers) across, compacted, causing the mountain to subside to about 1.5 feet (0.5 meters) lower than before the blast. \"There may be continuing post-explosion compaction at the mountain. It takes time for these aseismic processes to occur,\" Dreger said.","tags":"Article","url":"/articles/2018/Nov/02/Nuclear/"},{"title":"Voting Architecture for the 21st century","text":"Voting architecture: devices, software, the cloud, and integrity Stanford's new center for cybersecurity is in formation.

In preparation, the BIDS team created a list of ten data sets to choose from. Some teams had worked together before; some teams formed, and reformed, in the two days of the Hackathon. By the end of the working sessions, teams presented work in process. Most teams chose a spatial presentation of the data sets, showing values of a variety of water-related parameters for specific areas. Establishing the boundaries of areas: water district service areas, or regional water sheds, or political or administrative districts, proved challenging. For social and demographic data, gathered in US Census Tracts, choosing how to partition the data to fit in water district or political district boundaries required many decisions, and resulted in discovery of many errors in existing spatial boundary definitions.","tags":"Deep Insight","url":"/articles/2018/Sep/15/first-post/"},{"title":"Hackathon Teams on Slack","text":"California Water Data Challenge Find names of each team...send notes","tags":"Article","url":"/articles/2018/Sep/15/hackathon/"},{"title":"California Water Board Hackathon 2","text":"California Water Data Challenge Evaluating all team entries - beyond first Jupyter Notebooks - data cleaning cost: time, complexity, data dictionary - long-term integration with existing state and local data collection","tags":"Article","url":"/articles/2018/Sep/15/second-post/"},{"title":"California Water Board Hackathon 3 Data Sets","text":"California Water Data Challenge Data Sets Data sets for water data cross-linking project: how to correspond data elements from separate State agencies?
