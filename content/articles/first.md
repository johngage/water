## California Water Data Challenge ##
###U C Berkeley Hackathon: September; California-wide award ceremony:October

Teams gathered at the Berkeley Institute of Data Science to spend two days creating new windows into California's publicly available water data.

In preparation, the BIDS team created a list of ten data sets to choose from.  

Some teams had worked together before; some teams formed, and reformed, in the two days of the Hackathon.

By the end of the working sessions, teams presented work in process.  Most teams chose a spatial presentation of the data sets, showing values of a variety of water-related parameters for specific areas.  

Establishing the boundaries of areas: water district service areas, or regional water sheds, or political or administrative districts, proved challenging.

For social and demographic data, gathered in US Census Tracts, choosing how to partition the data to fit in water district or political district boundaries required many decisions, and resulted in discovery of many errors in existing spatial boundary definitions.
