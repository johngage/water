### Sunnyside, Lake Tahoe:  Historical Sources

To build an accurate picture of the piers and buoys in Lake Tahoe over the past century, we must combine source documents from many repositories:
 - written documents from official sources, including Grant Deeds from Placer County, Tahoe Regional Park Authority, California State Lands Commission, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
 - Aerial and satellite imagery from a variety of sources.  Section 2 contains a listing of sources and holdings.

-There will be a Stakeholder Science Committee meeting on January 8, 2019, time TBD, at the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (128 Market St, Stateline, NV 89410).
