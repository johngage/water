###Planning Berkeley Future###



Last year, following the initiative by Gordon Wozniak and John Gage, Mayor Jesse Arreguín created the Berkeley 2050 Commission, ratified this November in Berkeley by the passage of Prop R.  We have four committees: Technology, Quality of Life, Financial and Management, and Environment. We plan to spend 2019 in a series of exploratory meetings with all elements of the Berkeley community, culminating in a comprehensive plan for infrastructure investment.

UrbanSim would be an ideal platform, it seems, for exploration of a range of possible futures in these meetings.

Berkeley will spend over $1 billion dollars in infrastructure maintenance, modification, and renovation in the next thirty years. We plan to explore the impact of new technologies on the costs of street surfacing and storm water treatment, waste water and clean water decentralization, energy system decentralization, re-engineering of all continuity systems--communications, energy distribution, water flows, transportation and materiel movement, piping systems,--and examine the costs and benefits of re-engineering all structures in Berkeley for resilience and efficiency.
