Viewing the ERDAS_IMG multi-layered images requires specialized software. A free desktop viewer, ERDAS ER Viewer is available from Hexagon Geospatial. ERDAS_IMG files can be viewed in GeoViewer, freely downloadable from LizardTech. ERDAS_IMG files can be read and written by ArcGIS Desktop and other ESRI applications. See Supported raster dataset file formats from ArcGIS help. It is also supported by Safe Software's FME engine for format conversion.

There appear to be two software libraries that support the reading and writing of ERDAS_IMG files:

The open source GDAL/OGR library. See GDAL: HFA -- Erdas Imagine .img. This capability in GDAL derives from a project evidently supported by Intergraph around 2004. Intergraph was owner of ERDAS IMAGINE software at the time. This project yielded a C++ API that is integrated into GDAL and also a utility img2tif designed to convert ERDAS_IMG files to GeoTIFFs. As of January 2015, the former link to the source code for img2tif (with a date of 2006) is no longer online. See former project page via the Internet Archive for more information. The compilers of this resource do not know whether GDAL support handles new variants of the ERDAS_IMG format. Comments welcome. This library is used by the open source QGIS and GRASS applications.
The IMAGINE Developers' Toolkit, included in the Producer suite of the Power Portfolio from Hexagon Geospatial. This toolkit supports reading and writing of ERDAS_IMG files.

### Tail end tag

# Section 1
The formula, $y=mx+c$, is displayed inline.
Some symbols and equations (such as
$\sum{x}$ or $\frac{1}{2}$) are rescaled
to prevent disruptions to the regular
line spacing.
For more voluminous equations (such as
$\sum{\frac{(\mu - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$),
some line spacing disruptions are unavoidable.
Math should then be displayed in displayed mode.
$$\\sum{\frac{(\mu - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$
