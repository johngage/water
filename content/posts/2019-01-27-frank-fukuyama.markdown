Our next author, **Frank Fukuyama**, got on a plane at LAX almost exactly thirty years ago, to take his new job in the US State Department in the Office of Policy Planning, George Kennan's old office.

He'd been working at RAND, in Santa Monica, studying the Russian collapse in 1989, and the end of the Cold War.

On his way to Washington, he stopped to gave a short talk in Chicago. That talk, entitled *The End of History?*, with a question mark at the end, took a sweeping view of world history. Frank described how fascism died in the Second World War, communism died with the now-collapsing Soviet Union, and how the result left the world with one commonly accepted economic and political framework agreed to by all nations--the ascendent liberal world order--combining individual rights, equal democracy, capitalism, international trade, and consumerism.

He predicted the next thirty years.

His question mark, however, cited forces clamoring for dignity and respect not addressed by liberalism: the forces of nationalism and religion--reflecting the desires of many to be superior, not equal to others--forces that might challenge liberalism.

Nine books and thirty years later, Frank Fukuyama revisits that question mark, in his new book, **Identity**, which he says he would not have written had Donald Trump not been elected. He calls Trump both the product of and a contributor to the decay of American institutions, and says why.

Frank Fukuyama, Identity.
