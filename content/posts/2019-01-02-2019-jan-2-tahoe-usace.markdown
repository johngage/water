### 2 Jan 2019 Army Corps of Engineers Applicatation Status

Monday, Bob Marston and I reviewed all imagery and other documentation so far assembled.

We agree that we must succeed in this application, and that, so far, we have a suggestive, but not conclusive case to present to Aaron Park at USACE.

I have superimposed all imagery in a GoogleEarth Pro document which allows us to compare the five major image collections. It draws on the Dropbox collection of thirty images. I will place the KML file in the Dropbox folder so Gary and Melissa can see what Bob and I reviewed.
